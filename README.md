# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The school board has requested this project after being notified that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered, suggesting academic dishonesty. I have been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, repeat the school district analysis, and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?

- How is the school summary affected?

- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools?

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    - Math and reading scores by grade
    
    - Scores by school spending
    
    - Scores by school size

## Summary
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
